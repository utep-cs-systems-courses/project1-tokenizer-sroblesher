Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).


To mantain the history of the sentences being entered there is a linked list
where the nodes are Items containing the Id and the sentence. It starts with a
dummy node at the root and then it continues normally by incrementing the Id
by 1 and storing the sentence.
